    "\n",
    "* With the email addresses, we have a good source to use in finding the full person record for contacts we want to add. We can't necessarily assume these are \"authors\" at this point, so we'll put them in as simple \"Point of Contact\" type contacts for this context.\n",
    "* We could do some sleuthing to really classify the links in different ways that could be really useful for the eventual catalog. For now, we can refer to the \"Link\" links with a title like \"Model Reference Link\" to basically put those links into a common context here. We'll title the others as \"Model Output\" for the time being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some really interesting things could start to spool out from this just by gathering the links together like this. Some of the links represent machine-readable end points where code could be written to gather structured metadata from those sources and use it to build out a more complete picture of the models. We can explore what that might look like down the road."

These \"description documents\" can then be fleshed out further within ScienceBase using both the edit interface and processes we can build later to use the item information as a start and then go out and gather new and fresh information from the web about the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue here is that the contact matching should really be handled on the ScienceBase API end. I added in a step to lookup actual contact information and identifiers for the email addresses from the ScienceBase Directory. This serves to connect the dots between these new model descriptions we are inserting and named identities associated with them. The most visible effect of this is that you'll be able to hover over the contacts inserted into ScienceBase, link through to the contact pages, and see these new items associated with that contact. Repository management wise, this helps to further flesh out the official record of scientific products associated with an individual researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shouldn't have to do this operation on the client side in an operation like this. Rather, ScienceBase should be able to connect the dots for us simply by us passing in a known identifier like a usgs.gov email address. We wouldn't want ScienceBase to automatically connect to a Directory identity for every contact like this, but if it's a usgs.gov email (and possibly other DOI emails) AND the identity is current in the Directory, then it would be reasonable to have that connection made automatically for us."

In both groups, some types are incredibly detailed while others are totally vague. I could have picked link types other than the generic \"webLink\" to try and classify these, but it would have been meaningless without working on the semantics for the vocabulary. As soon as any vocabulary gets this large and messy, it is incredibly important that the owners of the vocabulary provide actual working definitions for the terms through descriptions and/or relationships to other vocabularies. What we have now means that each collection has to essentially bring its own contextual meaning to its particular use of the vocabulary. Someone really needs to work on ScienceBase Catalog semantics."
