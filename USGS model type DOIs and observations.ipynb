    "After talking about the model catalog today, I got curious about the DOIs that have been minted in the USGS ID space that claim to be models. This notebook takes a look. A quick look at the DataCite works API shows that there are quite a few DOIs minted, with the majority coming from work I did to register all those GAP species habitat models. But there seem to be some other interesting things in there. I put in a process to pull all those together by paginating through the API results but then stash them in a Feather file in case for further reference."

The abstract and the web site list other interesting parts of the picture, including a USGS Open File Report describing the methods and what is possibly an \"off the books\" web page that purportedly accompanied a data release but is the kind of thing that might otherwise have ended up in a USGS Data Series or something similar with a journal.

The repo also has a CSV file that contains the input data for the model, which probably happens a fair bit depending on the size of the necessary data. It's not a bad practice, in some ways, to stash input data with the model. However, in this case, there's really not any real documentation in or with the dataset (species occurrence points and basic environmental condition) to understand where it came from without some sleuthing. So, it gets points for transparency, but some demerits for re-usability."

The most notable framework in USGS for distributing these data with some value-added services for statistical summarization is through the GeoDataPortal.

Unfortunately, ScienceBase seems to be taking some much needed time off this evening, so I can't pull up any of these. Descriptions look like model outputs, and I would guess that the ScienceBase Items might actually be classed as data releases (or at least they could have been). The nice thing about using ScienceBase as the backend landing system for these DOIs would be the reasonably simple structured metadata capability. I'd be looking for things like links to source code, links to associated publications, and links or relationships to input data that might have been structured into the items, making the production of a linked catalog more feasible."
