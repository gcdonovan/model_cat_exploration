    "After talking about the model catalog today, I got curious about the DOIs that have been minted in the USGS ID space that claim to be models. This notebook takes a look. A quick look at the DataCite works API shows that there are quite a few DOIs minted, with the majority coming from work I did to register all those GAP species habitat models. But there seem to be some other interesting things in there. I put in a process to pull all those together by paginating through the API results but then stash them in a Feather file in case for further reference."

       "      <td>Coastal managers and ocean engineers rely heavily on projected average and extreme wave conditions for planning and design purposes, but when working on a local or regional scale, are faced with much uncertainty as changes in the global climate impart spatially-varying trends. Future storm conditions are likely to evolve in a fashion that is unlike past conditions and is ultimately dependent on the complicated interaction between the Earth?s atmosphere and ocean systems. Despite a lack of available data and tools to address future impacts, consideration of climate change is increasingly becoming a requirement for organizations considering future nearshore and coastal vulnerabilities. To address this need, the USGS used winds from four different atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs) or Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the WaveWatchIII numerical wave model to compute historical and future wave conditions under the influence of two climate scenarios. The GCMs respond to specified, time-varying concentrations of various atmospheric constituents (such as greenhouse gases) and include an interactive representation of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice. The two climate scenarios are derived from the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5; World Climate Research Programme, 2013) and represent one medium-emission mitigation scenario (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5) and one high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The historical time-period spans the years 1976 through 2005, whereas the two future time-periods encompass the mid (years 2026 through 2045) and end of the 21st century (years 2081 through 2099/2100). Continuous time-series of dynamically-downscaled hourly wave parameters (significant wave heights, peak wave periods, and wave directions) and three-hourly winds (wind speed and wind direction) are available for download at discrete deep-water locations along four U.S. coastal regions: ? Pacific Islands [this should be hyperlinked] ? West Coast [this should be hyperlinked] ? East Coast [this should be hyperlinked] ? Alaska Coasts [this should be hyperlinked] The data and cursory overviews of changing conditions along the coasts are summarized in (make these into links.. or have them as a box on the right-hand-side as is currently the case.. if so, then change the text here to read ?? along the coasts are summarized in the documents provided in the right-hand-side box.?)

U.S. Geological Survey pamphlet to accompany data set, http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7D798GR The time-series data cursory overviews provide information on trends and variability of geophysical variables that are expected to respond to changes in global-scale forcing. The data are being used for and are made available for further evaluation of trends and variability in offshore conditions, and as boundary conditions for regiona-l and local-scale coastal hazard models. Because winds and waves are the key processes driving extreme water levels and wave-driven flooding, the data are expected to be crucial for projecting future transient sea-level extremes on coasts and for defining areas that might be vulnerable to changing wind and wave conditions.</td>\n",

       "113  Coastal managers and ocean engineers rely heavily on projected average and extreme wave conditions for planning and design purposes, but when working on a local or regional scale, are faced with much uncertainty as changes in the global climate impart spatially-varying trends. Future storm conditions are likely to evolve in a fashion that is unlike past conditions and is ultimately dependent on the complicated interaction between the Earth?s atmosphere and ocean systems. Despite a lack of available data and tools to address future impacts, consideration of climate change is increasingly becoming a requirement for organizations considering future nearshore and coastal vulnerabilities. To address this need, the USGS used winds from four different atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs) or Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the WaveWatchIII numerical wave model to compute historical and future wave conditions under the influence of two climate scenarios. The GCMs respond to specified, time-varying concentrations of various atmospheric constituents (such as greenhouse gases) and include an interactive representation of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice. The two climate scenarios are derived from the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5; World Climate Research Programme, 2013) and represent one medium-emission mitigation scenario (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5) and one high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The historical time-period spans the years 1976 through 2005, whereas the two future time-periods encompass the mid (years 2026 through 2045) and end of the 21st century (years 2081 through 2099/2100). Continuous time-series of dynamically-downscaled hourly wave parameters (significant wave heights, peak wave periods, and wave directions) and three-hourly winds (wind speed and wind direction) are available for download at discrete deep-water locations along four U.S. coastal regions: ? Pacific Islands [this should be hyperlinked] ? West Coast [this should be hyperlinked] ? East Coast [this should be hyperlinked] ? Alaska Coasts [this should be hyperlinked] The data and cursory overviews of changing conditions along the coasts are summarized in (make these into links.. or have them as a box on the right-hand-side as is currently the case.. if so, then change the text here to read ?? along the coasts are summarized in the documents provided in the right-hand-side box.?)

U.S. Geological Survey pamphlet to accompany data set, http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7D798GR The time-series data cursory overviews provide information on trends and variability of geophysical variables that are expected to respond to changes in global-scale forcing. The data are being used for and are made available for further evaluation of trends and variability in offshore conditions, and as boundary conditions for regiona-l and local-scale coastal hazard models. Because winds and waves are the key processes driving extreme water levels and wave-driven flooding, the data are expected to be crucial for projecting future transient sea-level extremes on coasts and for defining areas that might be vulnerable to changing wind and wave conditions.

    "This one from a USGS partner in Alaska that I know pretty well looks interesting. The DOI de-references to a web application run by Axiom Data Science that provides an interactive system to visualize and download the cached results (model output data) for a wave height and wind speed model that looks at both historic conditions and projected futures under several scenarios for coastal zones. The abstract and the web site list other interesting parts of the picture, including a USGS Open File Report describing the methods and what is possibly an \"off the books\" web page that purportedly accompanied a data release but is the kind of thing that might otherwise have ended up in a USGS Data Series or something similar with a journal. This is a pretty interesting case that has just about all the components for a model catalog except that I couldn't find the source code with a cursory look at least."

The DOI reference here points to a fine enough source repository, but it does present some challenges in terms of interfacing toward the model catalog idea. You really have to dig into the user manual in a Word document to get at deeper level information about the model, which means writing code to crawl and put pieces together here would be pretty challenging.\n",

    "I'd heard about the Sagebrush Hurdle Model but hadn't looked at the source code before. This is an interesting case where there is some useful metadata embedded in the README, namely a reference to a journal article that model was used in. The repo also has a CSV file that contains the input data for the model, which probably happens a fair bit depending on the size of the necessary data. It's not a bad practice, in some ways, to stash input data with the model. However, in this case, there's really not any real documentation in or with the dataset (species occurrence points and basic environmental condition) to understand where it came from without some sleuthing. So, it gets points for transparency, but some demerits for re-usability."

    "This is an interesting case of a minted DOI pointing to a provisional code repo sitting in a personal space in GitHub. I guess that's okay under policy, but it opens a few questions. I would tend to not mint a DOI for something that was not going to eventually be production code. Richie Erickson does provide a nice disclaimer up front in the README indicating that he doesn't expect someone to build on it. There's a title reference to an article that's now [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188494), and some guidance about following up to put those links into some type of code metadata that would support the reference would be a good thing to have."

       "      <td>A soil-water balance model (SWB) was developed to estimate evapotranspiration in six ditch basins of the Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge area, northwestern Minnesota, during 2002-2015. The model was used to estimate evapotranspiration in water balances in six ditch basins as part of the associated report, U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2019-5041 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/SIRXXXX). This SWB model was derived from the statewide Minnesota SWB potential recharge model, described, calibrated, and documented as part of U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015-5038 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20155038). The data sets and calibrations from the Minnesota statewide model were used without modification except for the more detailed precipitation, water capacity, and land use input data. In this model, precipitation data were interpolated from local raingages. Water capacity data were taken from the gSSURGO soils data base. Land-use data were compiled from three sources using the most detailed data: the National Land Cover Database, the Cropland Data Layer and data from the local Natural Resources Conservation Service office. Details of the procedures used to produce these three detailed data sets can be found in U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2019-XXXX (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/SIRXXXX). This model was not recalibrated. All calibrated parameters remain the same as those in the statewide Minnesota SWB model. The areal resolution of this model was increased to a 60-meter square grid and the temporal period was extended through 2015 relative to the statewide SWB model. Daymet (version 2) daily surface temperature data necessary to run this SWB model are available upon request through the following link: https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1219. Also included in this data archive is a file of selected hourly precipitation totals for six ditch basins used in HEC/HMS ditch-flow modelling described in the associated report.</td>\n",

The calibrated SWB model in this model archive and associated U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report is referred to as the glacial SWB model. Potential groundwater recharge was determined on a daily basis as precipitation in excess of interception, runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage capacity. Daily groundwater recharge amounts were aggregated to an annual basis for grids available in this model archive. Potential recharge as described in this report is water that infiltrates vertically below the plant rooting zone and is assumed to reach the water table. The glacial SWB model was calibrated to base-flow estimates calculated from daily streamflow data by the HYSEP local minimum method for 39 basins across the glacial aquifer system. The glacial SWB model provides insight into the spatial and temporal variability in potential recharge across the glacial aquifer system. The glacial SWB model was prepared as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's Glacial Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Study which assesses groundwater availability for the glacial aquifer system of the United States. Although potential recharge estimates and most model inputs are in units of inches per pound, spatial data such as model grid spacing and some model inputs use the International System of Units.</td>\n",

Building on previous work, BEWARE improves system understanding of reef hydrodynamics by examining the intrinsic reef and extrinsic forcing factors controlling runup and flooding on reef-lined coasts. The Bayesian estimator has high predictive skill for the XBNH model outputs that are flooding indicators, and was validated for a number of available field cases. BEWARE is a potentially powerful tool for use in early warning systems or risk assessment studies, and can be used to make projections about how wave-induced flooding on coral reef-lined coasts may change due to climate change.

       "      <td>As part of the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS), time series of hindcast, historical, and 21st-century nearshore wave parameters (wave height, period, and direction) were simulated for the southern California coast from Point Conception to the Mexican border. The hindcast (1980-2010) time series represents reanalysis-forced offshore waves propagated to the nearshore, whereas the historical (1976-2005) and 21st-century (2012-2100) time series represent global climate model-forced offshore waves propagated to the nearshore. Changes in deep-water wave conditions directly regulate the energy driving coastal processes. However, a number of physical processes, for example, refraction on continental shelves and/or diffraction by islands, transform deep-water waves as they propagate to the coast, which complicates large-scale modeling efforts. In this work, a hindcast of nearshore waves was simulated by forcing a numerical wave model with hindcasted intermediate-water waves and reanalysis winds. A lookup table was created by relating corresponding offshore winds and waves with nearshore wave conditions. Using the lookup table, historical and 21st-century nearshore wave time series were generated for global climate model-forced offshore winds and waves.</td>\n",

Three-hourly global climate model (GCM) wind speed and wind direction output from four different GCMs provided by the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5), were used as boundary conditions to the physics-based WAVEWATCH3 numerical wave model for the area encompassing the main Hawaiian islands. Two climate change scenarios for each of the four GCMs were run: the representative concentration pathway (RCP)-4.5 and RCP-8.5, representing a medium mitigation and a high emissions scenario, respectively. Simulation timeframes were limited to the years 2026-2045 and 2085-2100, as prescribed by the CMIP5 modeling framework. The WAVEWATCH3 modeled deep-water wave heights, wave periods, and wave directions, with current bathymetry were used as boundary conditions to drive simulations of mean and top 5 percent wave conditions at higher resolution over the insular shelves of the main Hawaiian islands using the 3rd-generation SWAN wave model. For each scenario, 12 simulations were made representing the month-averaged or top 5 percent conditions. The SWAN model is based on discrete spectral action balance equations, computing the evolution of random, short-crested waves. Physical processes such as bottom friction and depth induced breaking, and, non-linear quadruplet and triad wave-wave interactions are included. Wave propagation, growth, and decay are solved periodically throughout the model grid. The SWAN model has been shown to accurately model the propagation and breaking of waves over Pacific coral reefs. Model results have been broken into four island groups, and the data are available for download from the four child pages, below.</td>\n",

Resulting projections for future climate scenarios (sea-level rise and storms) provide emergency responders and coastal planners with critical storm-hazards information that can be used to increase public safety, mitigate physical damages, and more effectively manage and allocate resources within complex coastal settings. Several versions of CoSMoS have been implemented for areas of the California coast, including Southern California, Central California, and San Francisco Bay, and further versions will be incorporated as additional regions and improvements are developed.</td>\n",

The raster layers contained here accompany the manuscript Inman et al. 2018 and were used to evaluate utility of a novel bias correction method (modeled) over classic methods. Spatial predictions of habitat suitability were created using MaxEnt version 3.4.0 (Phillips et al., 2006), a widely-used software for SDM in presence-background frameworks. Detailed methods are provided in Inman et al. 2018.

We investigated potential effects of the commercial fishing moratorium put in place to help protect the similar-appearing pallid sturgeon (S. albus). The model applies different components of total variance in life history parameters at different levels: sampling variance (parameter uncertainty) between model iterations; temporal variance (temporal environmental fluctuations) between time steps within iterations; and individual variance (individual differences) within each time-step. The model predicted annual rates of population increase of 1.96% under historic fishing and 2.67% with removal of historic fishing. We identified combinations of fishing and harvest size restrictions that would permit a sustainable harvest of shovelnose sturgeon. Overall, the ban on commercial fishing of shovelnose sturgeon in the LMR due to similarity of appearance to pallid sturgeon should help the LMR shovelnose sturgeon population begin to rebound while decreasing any negative effects it may have had on pallid sturgeon populations.</td>\n",

       "7             A soil-water balance model (SWB) was developed to estimate evapotranspiration in six ditch basins of the Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge area, northwestern Minnesota, during 2002-2015. The model was used to estimate evapotranspiration in water balances in six ditch basins as part of the associated report, U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2019-5041 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/SIRXXXX). This SWB model was derived from the statewide Minnesota SWB potential recharge model, described, calibrated, and documented as part of U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015-5038 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20155038). The data sets and calibrations from the Minnesota statewide model were used without modification except for the more detailed precipitation, water capacity, and land use input data. In this model, precipitation data were interpolated from local raingages. Water capacity data were taken from the gSSURGO soils data base. Land-use data were compiled from three sources using the most detailed data: the National Land Cover Database, the Cropland Data Layer and data from the local Natural Resources Conservation Service office. Details of the procedures used to produce these three detailed data sets can be found in U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2019-XXXX (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/SIRXXXX). This model was not recalibrated. All calibrated parameters remain the same as those in the statewide Minnesota SWB model. The areal resolution of this model was increased to a 60-meter square grid and the temporal period was extended through 2015 relative to the statewide SWB model. Daymet (version 2) daily surface temperature data necessary to run this SWB model are available upon request through the following link: https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1219. Also included in this data archive is a file of selected hourly precipitation totals for six ditch basins used in HEC/HMS ditch-flow modelling described in the associated report.   \n",

The model was used to simulate coral larval dispersal patterns from a number of existing State-managed reefs and large tracks of reefs with high coral coverage that might be good candidates for marine-protected areas (MPAs) during 8 spawning events during 2010-2013. The goal of this effort is to provide geophysical data to help provide guidance to sustain coral health in Maui Nui, Hawaii, USA. Each model output run is available as a netCDF file with self-contained attribute information. Each file name is appended with the model-simulation date in YYYYMMDD format; the file name denotes the beginning of simulation portion of the model run, with the model starting and spinning up over two days before the model-simulation date in the file name.   \n",

By using this data service, the public can automate data access to LTRM fisheries data. UMESC has written a series of example Python scripts that illustrate data retrieval and plotting. These example scripts focus on plotting fish catch, but there are limitless geo-spatial, tabular, and plotting products that can be generated using this data interface. The GeoJSON data format can be readily consumed by JavaScript and JavaScript components (e.g. the open-source libraries of Leaflet) to create web-based or mobile mapping applications.   \n",

The calibrated SWB model in this model archive and associated U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report is referred to as the glacial SWB model. Potential groundwater recharge was determined on a daily basis as precipitation in excess of interception, runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage capacity. Daily groundwater recharge amounts were aggregated to an annual basis for grids available in this model archive. Potential recharge as described in this report is water that infiltrates vertically below the plant rooting zone and is assumed to reach the water table. The glacial SWB model was calibrated to base-flow estimates calculated from daily streamflow data by the HYSEP local minimum method for 39 basins across the glacial aquifer system. The glacial SWB model provides insight into the spatial and temporal variability in potential recharge across the glacial aquifer system. The glacial SWB model was prepared as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's Glacial Aquifer System Groundwater Availability Study which assesses groundwater availability for the glacial aquifer system of the United States. Although potential recharge estimates and most model inputs are in units of inches per pound, spatial data such as model grid spacing and some model inputs use the International System of Units.   \n",

Building on previous work, BEWARE improves system understanding of reef hydrodynamics by examining the intrinsic reef and extrinsic forcing factors controlling runup and flooding on reef-lined coasts. The Bayesian estimator has high predictive skill for the XBNH model outputs that are flooding indicators, and was validated for a number of available field cases. BEWARE is a potentially powerful tool for use in early warning systems or risk assessment studies, and can be used to make projections about how wave-induced flooding on coral reef-lined coasts may change due to climate change.

The hindcast (1980-2010) time series represents reanalysis-forced offshore waves propagated to the nearshore, whereas the historical (1976-2005) and 21st-century (2012-2100) time series represent global climate model-forced offshore waves propagated to the nearshore. Changes in deep-water wave conditions directly regulate the energy driving coastal processes. However, a number of physical processes, for example, refraction on continental shelves and/or diffraction by islands, transform deep-water waves as they propagate to the coast, which complicates large-scale modeling efforts. In this work, a hindcast of nearshore waves was simulated by forcing a numerical wave model with hindcasted intermediate-water waves and reanalysis winds. A lookup table was created by relating corresponding offshore winds and waves with nearshore wave conditions. Using the lookup table, historical and 21st-century nearshore wave time series were generated for global climate model-forced offshore winds and waves.   \n",
       "114   Projected wave climate trends from WAVEWATCH3 model output were used as input for nearshore wave models (for example, SWAN) for the main Hawaiian Islands to derive data and statistical measures (mean and top 5 percent values) of wave height, wave period, and wave direction for the recent past (1996-2005) and future projections (2026-2045 and 2085-2100). Three-hourly global climate model (GCM) wind speed and wind direction output from four different GCMs provided by the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5), were used as boundary conditions to the physics-based WAVEWATCH3 numerical wave model for the area encompassing the main Hawaiian islands. Two climate change scenarios for each of the four GCMs were run: the representative concentration pathway (RCP)-4.5 and RCP-8.5, representing a medium mitigation and a high emissions scenario, respectively. Simulation timeframes were limited to the years 2026-2045 and 2085-2100, as prescribed by the CMIP5 modeling framework. The WAVEWATCH3 modeled deep-water wave heights, wave periods, and wave directions, with current bathymetry were used as boundary conditions to drive simulations of mean and top 5 percent wave conditions at higher resolution over the insular shelves of the main Hawaiian islands using the 3rd-generation SWAN wave model. For each scenario, 12 simulations were made representing the month-averaged or top 5 percent conditions. The SWAN model is based on discrete spectral action balance equations, computing the evolution of random, short-crested waves. Physical processes such as bottom friction and depth induced breaking, and, non-linear quadruplet and triad wave-wave interactions are included. Wave propagation, growth, and decay are solved periodically throughout the model grid. The SWAN model has been shown to accurately model the propagation and breaking of waves over Pacific coral reefs.

While global climate models (GCMs) provide useful projections of near-surface wind vectors into the 21st century, resolution is not sufficient enough for use in regional wave modeling projects, such as CoSMoS. Short-duration high wind speeds, on the order of hours, are of key importance in wave and subsequent coastal flood modeling. Here we present temporally downscaled wind data for historical (1975-2004) and projected (2010-2100) time periods, developed using a method similar to constructed analogues (CA), suitable for use in local wave models.   \n",

Resulting projections for future climate scenarios (sea-level rise and storms) provide emergency responders and coastal planners with critical storm-hazards information that can be used to increase public safety, mitigate physical damages, and more effectively manage and allocate resources within complex coastal settings. Several versions of CoSMoS have been implemented for areas of the California coast, including Southern California, Central California, and San Francisco Bay, and further versions will be incorporated as additional regions and improvements are developed.   \n",

The raster layers contained here accompany the manuscript Inman et al. 2018 and were used to evaluate utility of a novel bias correction method (modeled) over classic methods. Spatial predictions of habitat suitability were created using MaxEnt version 3.4.0 (Phillips et al., 2006), a widely-used software for SDM in presence-background frameworks. Detailed methods are provided in Inman et al. 2018.

We investigated potential effects of the commercial fishing moratorium put in place to help protect the similar-appearing pallid sturgeon (S. albus). The model applies different components of total variance in life history parameters at different levels: sampling variance (parameter uncertainty) between model iterations; temporal variance (temporal environmental fluctuations) between time steps within iterations; and individual variance (individual differences) within each time-step. The model predicted annual rates of population increase of 1.96% under historic fishing and 2.67% with removal of historic fishing. We identified combinations of fishing and harvest size restrictions that would permit a sustainable harvest of shovelnose sturgeon. Overall, the ban on commercial fishing of shovelnose sturgeon in the LMR due to similarity of appearance to pallid sturgeon should help the LMR shovelnose sturgeon population begin to rebound while decreasing any negative effects it may have had on pallid sturgeon populations.   \n",

    "I already know about the GAP habitat maps, but I was curious about what other \"models\" are distributed via ScienceBase. It looks like some cool stuff online. A bunch of missing descriptions is problematic and something that should be easily fixed in the DOI system. Unfortunately, ScienceBase seems to be taking some much needed time off this evening, so I can't pull up any of these. Descriptions look like model outputs, and I would guess that the ScienceBase Items might actually be classed as data releases (or at least they could have been). The nice thing about using ScienceBase as the backend landing system for these DOIs would be the reasonably simple structured metadata capability. I'd be looking for things like links to source code, links to associated publications, and links or relationships to input data that might have been structured into the items, making the production of a linked catalog more feasible."
